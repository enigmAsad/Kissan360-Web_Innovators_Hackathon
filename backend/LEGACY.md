# Legacy (cleaned)

All legacy modules from the starter project have been removed to avoid confusion and reduce scope.

Active modules are defined in `backend/server.js` and fully documented in `api-docs.md`.

If new modules are introduced outside the documented scope, please add them to `api-docs.md` and wire them in `server.js` explicitly.
